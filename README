# TriageAI — Primary Care Pre-Visit Intake Summarizer (MVP)

TriageAI is a lightweight AI-powered prototype that summarizes patient-reported pre-visit intake information into concise, clinician-friendly documentation for primary care visits.

The goal is to reduce time spent on repetitive intake questions while preserving clinical judgment, safety, and human oversight.

---

## Problem

In primary care, clinicians often spend valuable visit time reviewing basic intake information that could have been collected and summarized beforehand. This leads to:
- Reduced face-to-face time for complex issues
- Repetitive questioning
- Documentation burden
- Lower patient and clinician satisfaction

---

## Solution

TriageAI allows patients to complete a structured intake form prior to their appointment. An AI model then:
- Synthesizes the information into a neutral, clinician-ready summary
- Highlights key medical history and social factors
- Flags missing or unclear information for follow-up
- Avoids diagnoses, recommendations, or clinical decision-making

The output is designed to support — not replace — clinician judgment.

## What the AI Does (and Does Not Do)

### ✅ The AI:
- Summarizes patient-reported information
- Uses conservative, clinician-appropriate language
- Flags missing or unclear details
- Produces structured, predictable output
- Maintains clear safety boundaries

### ❌ The AI does NOT:
- Provide medical advice
- Make diagnoses
- Suggest treatments
- Score risk or triage urgency
- Replace clinical decision-making

## Example Output

> *“The patient is a 25-year-old female presenting for obesity management. She has a history of diabetes and hypertension. The onset of obesity was noted 3 years ago, with a reported worsening trend. Current medication includes Ozempic. The patient reports daily alcohol intake and a history of vaping. No allergies were reported.”*

## Intended Users

- Primary care clinicians
- Clinical operations teams
- Product managers exploring AI workflows in healthcare
- Interviewers evaluating applied AI judgment in regulated domains

---

## Design Principles

- **Safety-first:** conservative language, no clinical decisions
- **Transparency:** all outputs are clearly labeled as AI-generated
- **Clinician control:** AI assists documentation, not care decisions
- **Scope discipline:** focused on intake summarization only

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **AI Model:** OpenAI (structured JSON outputs)
- **Language:** Python
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud
